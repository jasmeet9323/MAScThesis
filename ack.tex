\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge and thank all the people who were a part of my graduate degree at UBC. These include the professors who taught me in lectures, my classmates, my labmates, people in the broader graduate community with whom I met at various academic and social events, my friends and peers. Special thanks to my labmates - Gary, Ehsan, Akhil, Shahzaib, Michael, Nick, and Mohammad. They have extended their help whenever I was in need.

I would also like to thank my parents. It was because of their selfless sacrifices that I am able to write this thesis.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Carl Ollivier-Gooch. I have learnt much more from him than what can be reflected in this document. His patience and diligence has inspired me since I joined UBC as a graduate student and will continue to do so in the future.
