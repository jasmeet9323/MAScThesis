\chapter{Lay Summary}

Discretization of geometries using a non-regular arrangement of mesh elements, called unstructured- mesh generation, is used widely for simulating flow over various objects in industry and government. The region near the surfaces of objects is particularly important during the simulation process because of the extreme non-linearity in the flow characteristics near the boundaries of objects. Hence, generating a well-discretized boundary layer mesh is key to superior flow simulation results. 3D mesh generation methodologies use a surface mesh as the starting point. Hence, the surface mesh plays an important role in the overall fluid flow simulation process.

A method to generate surface meshes which can be extended to three dimensions is demonstrated. The meshes produced will have improved ability to tackle boundary layer flows. Example meshes are produced which demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm developed.
