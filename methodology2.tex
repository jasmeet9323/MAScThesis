\chapter{Methodology Part 2: Advancing Several Layers}

In the previous chapter, we talked about how the very first layer of the mesh is generated. Starting from the discussion of extruding one boundary vertex onto the sub-surface, we went on explained how all the vertices on the boundary curve of the sub-surface are extruded and subsequently, how the advancing front is recovered so as to move on to the next layer. In this chapter, we are going to discuss some of the important subroutines which help complete the anisotropic surface mesh.
