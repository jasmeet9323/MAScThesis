Computational Fluid Simulations (CFD) is a field of study where scientists and engineers architect new ways to numerically solve fluid flow equations. Before the advent of computers, numerical solutions of differential equations was done by hand. This lead to a great deal of work in the direction of creating faster algorithms to solve differential equations. An example is the development of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) by Cornelius Lancoz to increase the computation speed of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). However, since the development and advancement of computers, engineers had a significant amount of compute power to work with. This lead to the development of highly accurate methods (as compared to before) to simulate flow over various objects. These simulations have since gotten bigger and better, typically including millions of degrees of freedom, even starting to touch a billion in regular industry use.

\section{Mesh Generation - A brief Overview}

The equations which govern the conservation of mass, momentum and energy of a moving fluid also called Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the given domain to simulate fluid flow in that domain. In order to numerically solve these equations, we need a discretization of the given domain. This discrete basis required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations is called a mesh. Simply put, a mesh is a collection of points, lines and cells that together construct the space around a body in a fluid flow.

The process of discretization of the domain to form the basis of solving the Navier-Stokes equations, or any other differential equation numerically is called mesh generation. Save a few exotic methods, almost all of the techniques in CFD require a mesh to solve the flow on. Traditionally, mesh generation was a very manual process, where engineers used to place the mesh points and cells by hand. Such heuristic approach to mesh generation gave them a lot of freedom in discretizing the domain. Cells could be aligned to the boundaries of objects. The quality of the cells, which was taken as some measure of the interior angle of the cells, was almost always chosen to be good. The benefits of this method were quite evident. However, there were some major drawbacks. The process of mesh generation was incredibly slow. Engineers would spend hours, sometime days to create the mesh for a given geometry. Also, mesh adaptation with solution was almost non-existant because that would have made the process even slower.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{mesh} $M$ is a geometrical discretization of a domain $\Omega$ that consists of (a) a collection of mesh entities $M_i$ of controlled size and distribution and (b) topological relationships or adjacencies forming the graph of the mesh. The mesh $M$ covers $\Omega$ without neither overlap nor hole.
\end{definition}

\section{Structured and Unstructured Meshes}

The evolution of mesh generation can be correlated to the evolution of compute power available to the boffins. With the advent of third generation computers (1964-1971) carryinig integrated circuits, engineers were able to automate some of the manual processes in mesh generation. Meshes consisting of a template that repeats itself could be generated. These meshes were called \textit{structured meshes} as their adjacencies or relationships could be known implicitly. Consider a grid in two dimensions as shown in Figure \ref{fig-structured-ij}. Given a cell $(i,j)$ we can identify its neighbours as $(i-1, j)$ to the left and $(i+1, j)$ to the right. Similarly, cell $(i, j+1)$ will be to the top and $(i, j-1)$ would be to its bottom. The connectivity pattern repeats in such a mesh. Figure \ref{fig-structuredNaca0012} shows a structured mesh generated for NACA 0012 airfoil around its leading edge. Notice the implicit connectivity of the cells even though the size of mesh elements is varying.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/intro/stucturedNaca0012.png}
  \caption{Structured mesh around leading edge of a NACA 0012 airfoil}
  \label{fig-structuredNaca0012}
\end{figure}


Structured meshes were attractive to engineers because of their low memory usage as the topology of the cells is repeated. Also, given simple domains to mesh, these meshes were optimal for minimizing the errors in CFD, resulting in faster simulations \cite{d1991optimal}. Programming CFD solvers with these meshes was easy as cell connectivity occurs in a regular fashion. However, as the scope of CFD simulations grew over time and more complex geometries were becoming commonplace, the task of generating structured meshes around them proved to be a daunting one. 

The disadvantage of using a structured mesh for more complex geometries is the increase in grid non-orthogonality or skewness that can cause unphysical solutions due to the transformation of the governing equations \cite{TU2013219}. The transformed equations that accommodate the non-orthogonality act as the link between the structured coordinate system (such as Cartesian coordinates) and the body-fitted coordinate system, but contain additional terms, thereby augmenting the cost of numerical calculations and difficulties in programming. Hence, a structured mesh may affect the accuracy and the efficiency of the numerical schemes used by a solver. Additionally, the tedious process of generating such meshes for more complex geometries was hard to justify. Hence, more flexible and automatic methods were devised. These methods produced meshes in a more random manner but with lesser human intervention. Broadly, the meshes produced by such methods were classified as \textit{unstructured meshes}. Figure \ref{fig-unstructured} shows an unstructured mesh. The arrangement of the mesh elements is random. Along with the shape of the elements, we need a data structure to store the adjacencies of the mesh.

The cost of finding flux at a wall, a widely used parameter in Finite Volume Methods (FVM), for unstructured meshes is high as compared to their structured counterparts. Also, the amount of memory usage is also high as the topology of the mesh is no longer repeated. Still, they are more widely used today because of their capability to handle arbitrary complex geometries, their capability to automate the mesh generation process and their flexibility in refinement based on the geometry topology and/or the solution gradients. Figure \ref{fig-unstructuredNaca0012} shows an unstructured mesh at the leading edge of a NACA 0012 airfoil. Notice the random arrangement of triangles around the airfoil geometry. The connectivity at each vertex of the mesh needs to be stored separately.

\section{Simplicial and Non-Simplicial Meshes}
\label{sec-simplicial}

Before discussing about simplicial and non-simplicial meshes, we need to define certain terms. In geometry, a simplex is a generalization of teh notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. For example, a 0-simplex is a point, a 1-simplex is a line segment, a 2-simplex is a triangle and a 3- simplex is a tetrahedron. See Figure \ref{fig-simplices} for an illustration.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/intro/simplices.png}
	\caption{$n$ dimesnional simplices.}
	\label{fig-simplices}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{k-simplex} is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k+1 vertices
\end{definition}

A simplicial complex is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts. In other words, a simplicial complex is a set strictly containing simplices only. Figure \ref{fig-simplicialComplex} shows a three-dimensional simplicial complex.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{simplicial complex} K
is a set of simplices that
satisfies the two following
conditions:
a) Any face of a simplex
 from K is also in K
b) The intersection of any
 two simplices S1 and S2
 is either $\phi$ (null set) or a face of
 both S1 and S2
\end{definition}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/intro/simplicalComplex.png}
	\caption{A three-dimensional simplicial complex.}
	\label{fig-simplicialComplex}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/intro/triangulation.png}
	\caption{Triangulation of a torus.}
	\label{fig-triangulation}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

A mesh which contains only simplicial mesh elements is called a simplicial mesh. For example, a mesh which contains only triangular simplices is called a triangulaiton. In other words, a \textbf{triangulation} is the division of a surface or plane polygon into a set of triangles, usually with the restriction that each triangle side is entirely shared by two adjacent triangles. It was proved in 1925 that every surface has a triangulation, but it might require an infinite number of triangles. Figure \ref{fig-triangulation} shows a triangulation of a torus.

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{triangulation} of a topological space X is a simplicial complex K, homeomorphic to X, together with a homeomorphism h: K $\rightarrow$ X.
\end{definition}

A non-simplicial mesh is simply a mesh which is not simplicial. Such a mesh contains mesh elements other than simplices too. For example, in two dimensions, a mesh which contains quadrilateral elements or quads will be called a non-simplicial mesh. In three dimensions, a mesh containing hexahedral elements would fall under the category of non-simplicial meshes.

Simplicial elements have been traditionally used for mesh generation. These elements are simple to work with and provide good flexibility in terms of discretization of a domain. These benefits make simplicial meshes very simple to produce. However, some of the drawbacks of simplicial meshes have led to mesh generation techniques with non-simplicial elements. Consider a triangulation of a surface. The Euler Formula states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges. Mathematically,

\begin{equation}
V-E+F=2
\label{eqn-eulerFormula}
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges and $F$ is the number of faces in the polyhedron. For a triangulation, each edge is shared by two faces. Also, each face has three edges associated with it. Hence, the number of faces is $2/3$ times the number of edges, or $F= (2/3) \times E$. Substituting this in equation \ref{eqn-eulerFormula}, we get

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
		V - E + F  & = 2 \\
		V - E + \frac{2}{3} \: E & = 2 \\
		V - \frac{1}{3} \: E & = 2 \\
		3V & \approx E
		\end{split}
\end{align}

Hence, the number of edges is three times the number of vertices in a triangulation (asymptotically). On the other hand, the number of edges is two times the number of vertices for a closed quadrilateral surface mesh. A similar derivation could be done for three-dimensional simplicial and non-simplicial elements. The number of edges in a tetrahedral mesh is about seven times the number of vertices. On the other hand, in a hexahedral mesh, the number of edges is only about three times the number of vertices (asymptotically). Higher connectivity for simplical meshes leads to higher computational cost when refining the mesh using a vertex-based discretization methods. Hence, non-simplicial meshes are substantially more efficient than simplical meshes for a given number of unknowns or grid points.

Additionally, regular arrays of nonsimplical elements may also enhance accuracy, owing to a local cancellation of truncation errors that may not occur on groups of nonsimilar simplical elements \cite{mavriplis1997unstructured}. In two-dimensions, quadrilateral elements have been preferred over triangles in highly stretched two-dimensional grids due to their lower connectivity \cite{aftosmis1994accuracy}. These advantages of non-simplical mesh elements have resulted in fully non-simplicial mesh generation techniques \cite{blacker1991paving, zhu1991new}. The scheme introduced by Blacker \etal uses a paving methodology with several mesh element collision checks and special conditions for the concave corners to generated an isotropic all-quad two-dimensional mesh for complex geometries. One such mesh is shown in Figure \ref{fig-quadMesh}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[trim={0 65.5cm 0 14cm },clip,width=\linewidth]{img/intro/lit/quadMesh.png}
	\caption{A non-simplical quad mesh generated with paving methodology \cite{blacker1991paving}.}
	\label{fig-quadMesh}
\end{figure}

Even though non-simplical mesh elements have been favored for a variety of scenrarios in mesh generation, and especially while generating highly-stretched elements, they have their cons. It is significantly difficult to generate an automatic mesh generation strategy which creates non-simplicial mesh conforming to complex surface and 3D geometrical configurations. Manual input is usually required to mesh such geometries. In these situations, simplical mesh elements are quite useful in dealing with the complexity in the geometry. Hence, a hybrid mesh containing both simplical and non-simplical mesh elements is a reasonable choice for mesh generation. We would revisit this in section \ref{sec-motivation} where we reason about choosing a hybrid scheme to mesh the surface.

\section{Boundary Layer Meshes}
\label{sec-boundaryLayerMesh}

With the advent of several unstructured mesh generation techniques (cite them), a broader selection of geometries could be dealt with. This immensely increased the scope of CFD solvers and pushed the limits of numerical methods in terms of accuracy and speed. However, a different approach was needed for the parts of the mesh in which viscous forces were more dominant as compared to the inertial forces. In other words, at the location of the viscous boundary layer, the gradient of physical measures like velocity is several magnitudes higher in one direction as compared to its orthogonal direction. A mesh generation technique which would help in resolving such strong gradients of the velocity in the boundary layer was required. For example, consider a flow over a flat plate as shown in Figure \ref{fig-boundaryLayer}. The velocity of the fluid at the surface of the plate is zero. However, the velocity becomes freestream velocity $u_0$ very near to the surface. The thickness of this layer of fluid, where the freestream velocit	y goes from a value of zero to a value of around 0.95 times the freestream velocity is called as the boundary layer thickness $\delta$. It is also called the viscous boundary layer as the viscous effects are dominant in this layer.

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/intro/boundaryLayer.jpg}
  \caption{Fluid flow over a flat plate.}
  \label{fig-boundaryLayer}
\end{figure}

\section{Anisotropic Meshing}

The need to resolve the steep gradients at the boundary layer of the fluid flow gave rise to a type of mesh development strategy called anisotropic meshing. An anisotropic mesh is simply a mesh which has highly stretched elements. In other words, the aspect ratio of the elements for an anisotropic mesh would be really high. Such a packing of the cell elements is required to provide a large number of Degree Of Freedom (DOF) along the direction of steep gradients of physical quantities such as velocity. Traditionally generated isotropic meshes are incapable of resolving such steep gradients \cite{frey2005anisotropic}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.5\linewidth}

	  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/intro/isotropic.png}

		\label{fig-anisotropic}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Isotropic and Anisotropic Mesh Fragments}
	\label{fig-isotropic-anisotropic}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig-isotropic} shows an isotropic mesh. The mesh elements have almost equal edge lengths. Here, the mesh elements are triangles and resemble equilateral triangles for most parts of the mesh. Given a point in the mesh, all the directions are the same and there isn't any bias towards a particular direction. For an isotropic physical process, such a mesh will serve the purpose and resolve gradients in all directions given the resolution of the mesh is appropriately chosen. However, if the physical process to be simulated is highly anisotropic, such as the velocity distribution along the boundary layer of the flat plate, as discussed in section \ref{sec-boundaryLayerMesh}, such a mesh will fail to resolve the steep velocity gradients. It would have to be refined to get the required refinement at the boundary, increasing the total number of DOFs in the mesh by a polynomial factor. Hence, a more reasonable mesh generation strategy is needed.

Figure \ref{fig-anisotropic} shows an anisotropic mesh. The triangular elements of the mesh are highly streched, with one edge being considerably shorter than the other two. The number of DOFs is distributed over the domain in a fashion so as to have the majority of the DOFs along the steep gradients of the physical quantities to be simulated. Hence, cell alignment with the solution to capture anisotropic flow features is possible with such a mesh.

\subsection{Brief Literature Review - Anisotropic Meshing}

Several techniques have been developed to generate meshes in two dimensions with some sort of anisotropy. Some of these techniques have also been generalized to surfaces. However, isotropically-meshed surfaces with a smooth element-size variation are generally easier to mesh than anisotropically-meshed surfaces with strong size variations \cite{TU2013219}. Many techniques developed in 2D have been generalized to 3D while some new methodologies have been deviced for volume meshing. We go over some of these methods briefly.

\subsubsection{2D and Surfaces}

Most of the initial attempts at generating stretched element meshes in two dimensions used a Delaunay mesh and a locally mapped space to get the required level of anisotropy  \cite{mavriplis1990adaptive}. A mesh generated by such a method is shown in Figure \ref{fig-mavri}. Some techniques used an approach of using a locally structured or semi structured mesh for the regions requiring high anisotropy  \cite{nakahashi1987fdm}.

\begin{figure*}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Initial mesh (a) and adaptively generated anisotropic mesh (b) using solution metric evaluation	\cite{castro1997anisotropic}.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

Many attempts at generating anisotropic meshes come under the category of metric adaptation of the mesh. These techniques generally used a Delaunay type initial mesh and refined it anisotropically using a solution metric. Shimada \etal provided an automated method to obtain anisotropic triangulation of a parametric surface. Given a domain geometry and a tensor field that specifies desired anisotropic node-spacing, a proximity-based interacting force field is defined and the force balance configuration is dynamically simulated \cite{shimada1997anisotropic}. Castro \etal applied mesh adaptation technique to generate anisotropic meshes, to compressible viscous flows for a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers \cite{castro1997anisotropic}. An illustration of this method can be seen in Figure \ref{fig-castro}. 

Kunert \etal showed an anisotropic mesh generation algorithm that refines the mesh anisotropically by calculating the local error estimate on the initial mesh \cite{kunert2002toward}. This algorithm was presented for both two dimensional and three dimensional meshes. Another mesh adaptation technique by Li \etal tried to align the mesh to a calculated metric tensor from the physics of the problem \cite{li2010anisotropic}. Figure \ref{fig-anisotropicMeshAdaptation} shows one such mesh.

\begin{figure*}
\centering

	\caption{Anisotropic quadrilateral mesh generated with an input triangulation and solution contours \cite{viswanath2000quadrilateral}.}
	\label{fig-anisotropicQuadMesh}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

A family of anisotropic mesh generation techniques fall under the Advancing Layer category. A method introduced by Pirzadeh produced unstructured triangular/tetrahedral grids with high-aspect-ratio cells using the advancing layer or the grid-marching strategy \cite{pirzadeh1994unstructured}. Another method which used the advancing layer strategy, with several mesh collision checks, was introduced by Lohner \cite{lohner1993matching}. Here, the mesh was produced by inflating the boundary curves in the direction of surface normals. Special care was taken while dealing with the concave corners of the mesh so as to avoid mesh element collisions.

While the majority of anisotropic mesh generation strategies focused on simplicial mesh elements, there have been some works which generate all quadrilateral (quad) surface meshes. A method by Lee \etal showed an anisotropic quadrilateral mesh generation scheme which generates a background triangular mesh and then proceeding with a cell merging procedure in the parametric space to produce the desired mesh \cite{lee2003new}. A different kind of method was adopted by Viswanath \etal to generate quadrilateral meshes with anisotropy and directional control \cite{viswanath2000quadrilateral}. A 2D geometric domain and desired level of anisotropy - as a metric tensor over the domain - specifying mesh sizing in two independent directions is taken as an input. Thereby node locations are calculated by closely packing recctangles in accordance with the inputs. An example mesh generated with this strategy is shown in Figure \ref{fig-anisotropicQuadMesh}.

\subsubsection{3D}
\label{sec-3D}

	\label{fig-ito}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

Given an initial surface discretization, several 3D mesh generation algorithms have been generated to create anisotropic volume meshes. Many methods which generate two-dimensional anisotropic  meshes can be extended to 3D \cite{lohner1993matching, nakahashi1987fdm,castro1997anisotropic}.

A generalized advancing layer method for generating 3D boundary layer mesh was presented by Garimella \etal \cite{garimella2000boundary}. Model boundaries grow into the domain to fill to generate the mesh in this method. An example mesh can be seen in Figure \ref{fig-shephard}. Another method was introduced by Ito \etal \cite{ito2002unstructured}. Here, a hybrid mesh was generated which comprised of tetrahedra, prisms and pyramids. First, the domain was filled with an isotropic tetrahedral mesh. Subsequently, the boundary walls were shifted inwards and the resulting gap between the tetrahedra and the walls was filled up with prismatic elements. Figure \ref{fig-ito} shows a mesh generated using such a strategy. This mesh generation strategy, of using a highly anisotropic semi-structured mesh near the boundaries of the domain (however, with no gradation over the boundary of the domain), and an isotropic mesh further away from domain boundaries is quite common in 3D meshing. Another example of such a strategy is shown in the work done by Sahni \etal \cite{sahni2008adaptive}. Here, mesh adaptation was applied to a hybrid mesh, with semi-structured stretched elements at the boundary and isotropic elements away from the boundary. Figure \ref{fig-sahni} shows a mesh generated by this method.

The method used by Shimada and Yamada in two dimensions has also been extended to three dimensions to generate anisotropic tetrahedral meshes. Given an arbitrary input anisotropy function, the algorithm generates high quality anisotropic tetrahedral mesh that conforms to the input geometry \cite{yamakawa2000high}. A mesh generated from this method can be seen in Figure \ref{fig-yamakawa}.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{img/intro/lit/highQualityTetMesh.png}
	\caption{Anisotropic Tetrahedral Mesh generated using ellipsoidal bubble packing methodology  \cite{yamakawa2000high}}
	\label{fig-yamakawa}
\end{figure}

In another work, a metric-orthogonal anisotropic mesh is generated. In addition to aligning the mesh to a metric, mesh elements are also aligned with the eigenvectors \cite{loseille20093d}. The quality of the input metric strongly affects the output mesh.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/intro/lit/sahni.png}
	\caption{ Collection of mesh faces cut by the vertical center- plane through the adapted boundary layer mesh of a porcine aorta. The windows correspond to magnified views which also show the initial boundary layer mesh \cite{sahni2008adaptive}.}
	\label{fig-sahni}
\end{figure}

Another method which generates a hybrid mesh using semi-structured boundary layer mesh and an isotropic outer mesh was given by Ito \etal \cite{ito2007multiple}. Here, special treatment of sharp corners on the surface was done by adding multiple marching directions at the sharp corner. This resulted in generation of a better volume mesh. The research showed that if the corners of the surface mesh, from which the volume mesh is generated, are treated specially and are hence refined more than other regions of the surface, the volume mesh thus generated would be of superior quality. More importantly, such special treatments of sharp corners in the surface mesh helps to create semistructured elements (for viscous boundary layer mesh) around singular points on the surface. A very important problem addressed by this study is one of the pivotal reasons to write this thesis.

Consider Figure \ref{fig-cornerIto} from the work by Ito \etal \cite{ito2007multiple}. An intersection between three surfaces is considered. There are labeled $S_A, S_B$ and $S_C$. The surfaces can represent a wing upper surface, a blunt trailing edge and a fuselage, respectively. As most of the surface meshes are simplical, isotropic and don't treat corners specially, the task to generate a valid viscous boundary layer mesh from them is considerably difficult. This difficulty is compounded at complex corners like the one shown in the figure. The paper puts forward a technique to discretize the surface further by adding new nodes and faces to the surface at such corners. In the figure, nodes are added along the direction $BA$. This process helps in creating additional normal directions near the corners of the surface and solves the problem of singularity to a great extent.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec-motivation}

\subsection{Surface Mesh Generation Strategies}

Stretched volume meshes are generated from an initial triangulation of a surface. These surfaces are usually represented by Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines or NURBS in various Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages. Generation of the surface mesh requires a separate methodology or algorithm as compared to the two-dimensional mesh generation as the mesh elements include a third dimension.

%%Method1

A majority of surface mesh generation methods produce a surface mesh from the parametric mapping of a two-dimensional mesh onto a surface \cite{george1998delaunay, chen1997delaunay}. Usually, a two-dimensional Delaunay mesh is generated over a parametric surface and then mapped onto the curved surface. This method is attractive as it is simple and there are a number of robust Delaunay mesh generation schemes available to generate the initial two-dimensional mesh. However, the mapping from 2D to 3D doesn't always give satisfactory results in terms of mesh element quality. This method doesn't always form well shaped surface elements, especially when the surface derivatives vary over the domain \cite{owen1998survey}. Meshes generated by such methods are generally isotropic and simplical. Hence, in addition to dealing with the badly shaped elements, several other post-processing operations need to be applied to them before generating a boundary layer volume mesh.

%%Method2

A different approach to surface mesh generation is adopted by methods which use the first fundamental form of the surface. In such methods, a metric is derived from the parametric representation of the surface and mesh elements are placed over the surface in an advancing front fashion with respect to this metric. Culli\'ere deviced one such method where he used a nodal density function based on the curvature of the surface to discretize it \cite{cuilliere1998adaptive}. An advancing front triangular mesh generation method was presented where 3D parametric surfaces could be meshed with good quality mesh elements. Joseph \etal presented a method which used a Riemannian surface definition to determine the amount of distortion of the elements in parametric space. Thereby, an advancing front method is applied to utilize this metric and generate good quality triangular elements over the surface. Figure \ref{fig-joseph} shows a mesh generated with this method. These methods, which use the parametric representation of the surface produce good quality triangular surface meshes. However, they are not well-suited to generate three dimensional anisotropic meshes with highly stretched elements. Additionally, the elements generated by such methods are simplical and hence, have their own drawbacks as discussed in section \ref{sec-simplicial}.

Lastly, surface meshes can also be generated by placing the mesh elements directly on the surface of the geometry. Lao and Lu \cite{lan1996finite} provide a method to produce a surface mesh over a given analytical surface. A given element density function is utilized and mesh elements are placed on the analytical surface using the advancing front technique. The elements are optimized considering factors such as surface curvature, element to element turning angle and the given density distribution, to get a high-quality surface mesh. Figure \ref{fig-lu} shows meshes generated with this method. With respect to being an input for a 3D viscous boundary layer mesh, these meshes have similar drawbacks as the ones discussed earlier. Mesh elements generated are triangular rather than quadrilateral or hybrid. Also, there is an additional input to the mesh, which is the density function. Lastly, the boundary curves of the surface are not dealt with specially and the complete surface is isotropically meshed.

\subsection{Consolidating The Discussion}

%% 1. Hybrid
\subsubsection{Hybrid}
Consolidating our discussion on surface meshes, we find that most of the 3D surface meshes generated are triangular. In other words, these meshes are simplical. We discussed the pitfalls of using simplical mesh elements at the regions of anisotropy or at surface boundaries in \ref{sec-simplicial}. To recapitulate, higher vertex connectivity for simplicial meshes makes them inefficient when using a vertex-based discretization method. On the other hand, quad meshes in two dimensions and hex meshes in 3D are substantially more efficient than their simplicial counterparts for the same number of Degrees of Freedom. In addition to that, non-simplicial elements arranged in repeating arrays may enhance solution accuracy by local cancellation of truncation errors while their simplicial counterparts may fail to do so \cite{mavriplis1997unstructured}. Non-simplicial quadrilateral elements have been preferred over triangles in highly stretched two-dimensional grids due to their lower connectivity \cite{aftosmis1994accuracy}.

Even though non-simplicial elements are more efficient in mesh generation, conforming such elements to complex geoemtry remains a daunting task. Generally, manual input is required to generate all-quad surface meshes or all-hex volume meshes in the regions of geometric complexities. Hence, usage of simplicial mesh elements in these regions is a reasonable alternative. Hence, a surface mesh generation scheme is required, which generates a quad-dominant mesh with a very limited number of triangular elements. Regular arrays of highly-stretched quadrilateral elements should form the anisotropic boundary layer mesh. On the other hand, triangular elements could be used whenever one wants to conform to the geometry and increase the quality of the mesh elements generated.

%% 2. 3D
\subsubsection{Good Input For Anisotropic 3D Mesh}
Following the discussion from \ref{sec-3D}, it is particularly difficult to generate  hybrid 3D meshes from an isotropic surface discretization. At the minimum, several invalidation checks needs to be performed at the singularity points of the surface so as to generate a valid viscous 3D mesh. In addition to that, the anisotropy of the 3D mesh becomes extremely difficult to control at the complex corners of the surface if they are not handled specially. One solution discussed earlier was to add additional marching directions and nodes at the complex corners on the surface of the mesh so as to add additional normal directions near the complex corners. However, the root cause of the problem is the isotropic surface discretization which is completely unaware of its usage into a anisotropic 3D volume mesh generator. Hence,
